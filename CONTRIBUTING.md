## Contributor License Agreement

In order to contribute to this project, Fundament Software must have on file an individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) covering your contributions. Pull Requests, issues, and other contributions will not be merged/accepted until the CLA is signed. This is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of this project. This simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

To request a CLA to sign, you can either e-mail `contact@fundament.software`, or simply mention in your PR that you will need a CLA to sign, and where we should send it (over e-mail, in a DM, etc). This project is released under the Apache License v2.0, as provided in [LICENSE](LICENSE), so any contributions made must also be released under the same license.

## Submitting Changes

To get a build environment set up, following the instructions appropriate for your operating system in the [README](README.md) file. Once you have an environment set up, to submit a proposed change:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch.
- Make any changes necessary.
- Add new test cases. In the case of a bug fix, the tests should fail without
  your code changes.
- If applicable, modify the documentation as necessary, or clearly note on the PR that a missing documentation issue will need to be created.
- All CI status checks *must pass* before your PR will be reviewed.

If you need feedback on a work-in-progress PR, simply mark it as a draft PR in the GitHub interface and clearly state what feedback you require in the description.

## Issues

GitHub issues can be used to report bugs, report missing documentation, or submit feature requests.

When reporting a bug please include the following information:

- The exact version you were using (or git commit hash).
- Operating system version.
- A minimal test case that reproduces the issue and is as small as possible.
